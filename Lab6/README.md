# Multithreading 

  (1) Generation of Prime Numbers upto a limit supplied as Command Line Parameter. </br>
  (2) Computation of Mean, Median, Mode for an array of integers. </br>
  (b) Construct a Box Plot for a given data (array of integers) supporting outlier as well. </br>
  (3) Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort in a multihreaded fashion. </br>
  (4) Estimation of PI Value using Monte carlo simulation technique using threads. </br>
  (5) Computation of a Matrix Inverse using Determinant, Cofactor threads, etc. </br>

  (6) Implement a multi-threaded version of Binary Search with 4 threads. (assume no duplicates in the array) </br>
  (7) Extend the earlier version of Binary Search to support search in array with duplicated elements and the function displaying the indexes of multiple occurrences of the search key. </br>
  (8) Implement any two External Sorting Algorithms of your choice in a multithreaded fashion.
